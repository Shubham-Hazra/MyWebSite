            One of my favourite things to do in free time is to play chess. I
            used to play chess a lot as a child but then for some reason I lost
            touch with it, but recently with a huge boom of chess in the youtube
            industry, mainly because of Samay Raina, I picked it up again and am
            once again enjoying playing this marvellous ancient game. I also
            like watching chess youtubers like GothamChess and Agadmator. I like
            to try out new openings and am more of a tactical player. I mostly
            played online on sites like chess.com or lichess, however recently
            my wingmates have also started playing and we play together on this
            beautiful wooden board that I have. I would very much like to call
            myself a good player but that's just not true, however I do know
            that I enjoy playing this game and I hope to get much better at it.

            Ah, this is one hobby that people associate with CSE students the
            most, however it is true in my case. Growing up I used to read a lot
            of fiction and mystery novels. I used to go to this really nice
            library near my house every week to issue books. I read the kinds of
            Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings, Sherlock Holmes, Hardy Boys and
            Nancy Drew, Feluda and various others. I could'nt travel in trains
            without atleast two new comics, the likes of tinkle or chacha
            chowdhary. However growing up, slowly I have shifted from fiction
            towards non-fiction and reading books still remains one of my
            favorite pastimes.

            Since I wasn't all that athletic growing up, badminton is the one
            sport that I was good at and enjoyed playing. Not saying that
            badminton doesn't require you to be athletic but just saying that it
            certainly is less demanding than the other sports. I used to play
            badminton in my school in the games period and I still play
            badminton on a regular basis here in the institute. It remains to be
            one of my favourite sports. I do not pursue it competitively but
            instead like to just have fun playing with friends.

            Can you really call travelling a hobby? As this isn't something that
            you can just do in your free time, however I have just put it here
            as I really enjoy it. I really haven't travelled that much but I
            have thoroughly enjoyed however much I did travel. I have only
            travelled within the country and haven't really explored the
            southern regions of the country yet. I have visited Delhi, Haryana ,
            Shimla, Amritsar, Agra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Assam, Andaman and
            Nicobar etc. Recently got the chance to visit Ley Ladakh in the
            summer break and it was truly a surreal experience. I have made the
            resolution to travel more while in college and hope to see many new
            places and have many new experiences.

            YouTube is what I usually watch to entertain myself as I do not
            really watch movies or shows as they take up too much time and I get
            easily addicted and end up binging them and wasting a lot of time.
            Also there are so many different genres of entertainment to be found
            on youtube. I like to watch chess, educational, stand up comedy and
            tech videos. Some of the channels and Youtubers I like to watch are
            PewDiePie, Hacksmith, Dude Perfect, Mark Rober, Veritasium,
            Kurzgesagt, Sidemen, GothamChess, Tanmay Bhatt and Samay Raina.

            Playing computer games is also one of the things I enjoy very much.
            The first computer game that I have memories of is this bike racing
            game called Road Rash which was very popular back then. This was
            probably when I was 5-6 years old. After that came GTA Vice City,
            Prince of Persia, GTA San Andreas and various others. These were an
            integral part of my childhood and I have really fond memories of
            playing these with my friends. Currently e-Sports is on the rise and
            I have also indulged in it. At present I like to play valorant- a
            FPS game whenever me and my squad gets time and also take part in
            tournaments happening in the institute.

            I got into anime in my 8<superscrip>th</superscrip> standard with
            watching Death Note as my first anime and I was hooked! I could'nt
            believe how different it was from the cartoons and shows I had grown
            up watching. Death Note showed me that anime can be very
            intelligent, thought provoking, can have such great character and
            world building and such awesome plots. It was followed by animes
            like Naruto, Bleach, Code Geass, Parasyte and many more. It got me
            really interested in Japanese culture. Although I must admit that
            nowadays I don't watch anime that often but that is purely because I
            simply don't get enough time and not because I've gotten bored of
            them. That said I still do read mangas regularly and not just
            Japanese mangas but also manhuas, manwhas and webtoons.
